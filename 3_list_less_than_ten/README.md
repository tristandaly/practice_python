/*
Take a list, say for example this one:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the
elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from
 the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

Fun one.

Had to trial-and-error the if statements until I realized that I needed to
append to BOTH lists if under 5. No proposed solution was provided with this
exercise for comparison.
