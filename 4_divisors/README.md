Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of
all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a
  number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor
   of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)



This was pleasantly easy. Only bit missed (corrected after reviewing solution)
was the needed "+1" in the range list. I had forgotten briefly that the second
argument will dictate that the range leads until the value BEFORE it.
