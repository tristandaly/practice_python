Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or
not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)



Had to research concepts on this one. I was on my way to either creating a separate
list containing the reversal of the first, or somehow comparing the list with
itself using negative indices (using [::-1]).

The end result was the discovery of the reversed() method which gave a better,
more readable code. That's what counts, right?

2 offered solutions. I like mine the best :P
